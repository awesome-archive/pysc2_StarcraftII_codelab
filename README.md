# pysc2_StarcraftII_codelab

Codelab for Starcraft II pysc2 machine learning research 
You can see the current development [here](https://soygema.github.io/starcraftII_machine_learning/#0)
The goal is to offer a general overview of how the StarCraft II Learning environment works, bring out some machine learning concepts to get started.
It includes a overview in a how to train an agent using GCP 

## What you'll learn
What pySC2 and StarCraft II API are
Basics theoretical concepts of Deep Reinforcement Learning to get started
Basic interaction with StarCraft II API
Training and modify Machine Learning agent
Evaluating how training and evaluating works
Train a Machine Learning agent in GCP

## What you'll need
A computer connected to the internet with Python3 installed

-The library pySC2 installed

-Starcraft II game -no license required-

-keras

-keras-rl

## What you need to know
Basic driving of bash console
Basic knowledge of Python - data structures, lists, functions, loops -
Basic knowledge of object-oriented programming -classes, methods, decorators -
Conceptual knowledge about Neural Networks
